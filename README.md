# ITC-122

WEEK1 - Node.js up and running
First step toward a working web server application. Should have following files and functionality:

Files in the root directory:
package.json - with information about application
data.js - containing:
an array of at least 5 items (objects), where each item has at least 4 attributes
an exported getAll method that returns all array items
index.js - with code to launch a node.js web server on port 3000 and respond to requests. Should import data.js module.
Web server should send different responses for these urls:
http://localhost:3000 - shows some home-page information and total number of items in your array
http://localhost:3000/about - returns some information about self
Any other path returns a 404 status code and error message
WEEK2 - Express yourself
Simplify server application and add formatted pages, using Express and basic templating.

Install these node modules:
express, express-handlebars & body-parser
Convert index.js code to use Express syntax,
Update default route to show formatted information for each item in data array:
create home.handlebars template
render this template for requests to default route
pass data array to the handlebars template
display the list of items in data array
each item is linked to detail page with a query parameter identifying the item
Create a new server route that:
can be accessed like so - http://localhost:3000/detail?item=[VALUE]
renders a detail.handlebars template to :
show an appropriate page title
show the value submitted on request url
show a link back to home page
Create a .gitignore file in project folder that excludes the node_modules folder from git commits.
WEEK3 - Quality Matters
Learned about test driven development and key techniques for ensuring code quality. Practicing those with a 2-part assignment.

First:

Install ESlint and initialize an ESlint configuration file using the 'eslint:recommended' rule set.
Then add these to the eslint 'rules' file:
"prefer-arrow-callback": "warn",
"no-var": "warn",
Second:

Create three new methods in data.js module:

getItem - should return full data about the requested item
addItem - should add a new item to the data array, if it doesn't already exist
deleteItem - should delete the requested item
Each method should return information on whether the operation succeeded or failed.

Install the mocha and chai modules as 'dev dependencies' for the application.

Create a test script file in the /test folder, with Mocha+Chai test cases for the 'getItem', 'addItem' and 'deleteItem' methods. Create tests for both success & failure conditions.

All six test cases should pass when run via Mocha.

WEEK4 - DATABASE INTEGRATION
Storing data in MongoDb and accessing it with Node.js and Mongoose. For the online database, credentials provided via Canvas upon assigment submittal.

Update your Node.js application through the following steps:

Install the mongoose npm package,

Create a data model that:
connects to your database
defines a data schema,
exports your data model for use by other scripts,
Populate the new database collection with items from your existing data array.
Update your server's 'home' and 'detail' routes to use the new database instead of your JavaScript data array. Your detail page should display details of the requested item.
Create a new server route to 'delete' an item from your database on request. Your route should accept a requestquery parameter identifying the item to delete, and should return a response indicating whether delete succeeded or failed.
WEEK5 - REST APIS
Soon you'll build a front-end that needs to access your data. REST API's have now become necessary.

For this week, provide API routes for each of the methods exported by your data module:

get a single item
get all items
delete an item
add or update an item (new route) Most can be accessible via GET request but your add route will need to support a POST request.
Each API should:

support cross-origin access,
accept necessary query parameters or request body,
return appropriate JSON data on success,
return an error status code and message if something went wrong,
No changes are required to your UI or existing data methods. You can use Postman for API testing.
